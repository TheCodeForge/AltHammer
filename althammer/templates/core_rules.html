# Core Rules

<div class="nested-numbered-list">


# Introduction

AltHammer is a turn-based activation tabletop wargaming experience. It is intended to be played with your existing collection of wargaming models.

# General Rules

## Priority

In the event of inconsistency between two sources of rules, use the rule that is found in the earliest location in this list:

* Unit rules card
* Detachment rules
* Faction Rules
* Core Rules

# Definitions

If you are already familiar with tabletop wargames, you can probably skip these.

## Model

A single painted figurine.

## Roll Off

Both players roll a d6. The player who rolled higher wins the Roll Off. The player who rolled lower loses the Roll Off. If the result was a tie, both players roll again.

## Unit

A group of one or more Models which function as a team. Each Unit deployed to the battlefield must have a corresponding rules card.

## Unit Coherency

A description of whether or not the Models in a Unit are sufficiently close together.

To be considered "in Unit Coherency", each Model must be no more than 2" away from another Model in the Unit, and the unit may not be separated into two or more clusters of Models.

If the Unit has six or more Models, each Model must be no more than 2" from two other Models in the Unit, and the unit may not be separated into two or more clusters of Models.

Units must end all movement in Unit coherency.

At any point in the game, if a Unit is found to *not* be in Unit Coherency, the player controlling that unit must remove Models from the Unit until Unit Coherency is achieved. When removing Models to achieve Unit Coherency, do not activate On Death rules for the removed Models.

# Order of Play

## Determine Points Limit

Together with your opponent, agree on a points limit for the game of at least 500 points or higher. Suggested limits:

* Small: 500 points
* Medium: 1000 points
* Large: 2000 points
* Epic: 3000+ points

Additionally, if both players agree to it, the Sideboard optional rule may be enabled.

## Select Faction and Detachment

Select your army Faction and Detachment.

You do not have to reveal your selections to your opponent, but if your opponent reveals their selections to you, it would be unsportsmanlike to not reciprocate.

## Muster Army

Assemble a collection of Units in your chosen Faction, up to the agreed points limit.

All Units must have the Faction Keyword matching your chosen Faction. All units must satisfy any additional restrictions established by your chosen Detachment.

You must include at least one +Character+ model in your mustered army.

You may not include more than three copies of the same Unit, or more than six copies of a +Front Lines+ Unit, in your mustered army. 

Select one +Character+ Model as your army's +Warlord+.

## Set Up Battlefield

Set up a tabletop battlefield according to the agreed upon points limit:

* 500-1999 points: 44" x 60"
* 2000+ points: 44" x 90"

Add terrain features in a mutually agreeable manner. Overall terrain layout should be either reflectively or rotationally symmetric.

## Reveal Armies

Reveal your chosen Faction, Detachment, and mustered Units to the opposing player. Identify which Model is your +Warlord+.

## Sideboard Option

The Sideboard Option may be enabled by mutual agreement between players during the Determine Points Limit step. If any player declines the Sideboard Option, it is not enabled.

If the Sideboard Option is enabled:

* During the Muster Army step, assemble a collection of Units up to 500 points *above* the agreed points limit instead.

* After the Reveal Army step, Roll Off. Players alternate selecting and removing Units from their mustered army, until their remaining army is at or below the agreed points limit, beginning with the player who lost the Roll Off.

# Activation

When Activated, a Unit may do up to two of the following actions:

* Move
* Advance
* Magik
* Shoot
* Charge
* Fight

A unit may not Advance and Shoot in the same Activation.

A unit may not Advance and Charge in the same Activation.

A unit may not be Activated two turns in a row, unless it is the last remaining Unit in the army.

## Move

Each Model in the Unit may move up to the number of inches indicated by its Movement characteristic. 

Units must end their movement in Unit Coherency.

### Advance

### one.two.two

## one.three

# two

# three

## three.one
