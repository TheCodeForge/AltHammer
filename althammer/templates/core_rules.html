# Introduction

# Definitions

If you are already familiar with tabletop wargames, you can probably skip these.

## Model

A single painted figurine.

## Unit

A group of one or more **Models** which function as a team. Each **Unit** deployed to the battlefield must have a corresponding rules card.

## Unit Coherency

A description of whether or not the **Models** in a Unit are sufficiently close together.

To be considered "in Unit Coherency", each **Model** must be no more than 2 inches away from another **Model** in the **Unit**, and the unit may not be separated into two or more clusters of **Models**.

If the **Unit** has six or more **Models**, each **Model** must be no more than 2 inches away from two other **Models** in the **Unit**, and the unit may not be separated into two or more clusters of **Models**.

At any point in the game, if a **Unit** is found to *not* be in Unit Coherency, the opposing player may removee **Models** from the **Unit** until Unit Coherency is achieved.

# Activation

When Activated, a **Unit** may do up to two of the following actions:

* Move
* Advance
* Magik
* Shoot
* Charge
* Fight

## Move

Each **Model** in the **Unit** may move up to the number of inches indicated by its **Movement** characteristic. When the whole **Unit** has finished moving, the **Unit** must be in **Unit Coherency**.

### Advance

### one.two.two

## one.three

# two

# three
