# Feel No Pain X+

When this model or unit would take damage, roll a d6 for each point of damage assigned. For each unmodified result of "X" or greater, reduce the assigned damage by 1.

# Leader

During the [Reveal Armies and Formations](/rules/core_rules#reveal_armies_and_formations) step, attach this unit to an +Infantry+ or +Battleline+ unit that is not a +Character+ or +Epic Hero+.

The leading unit gainst the +Leader+ keyword, and the unit to which it attached gains the +Bodyguard+ keyword.

For the rest of the battle, this combined force shall be treated as a single unit with a starting strength of the combined model count.

If either the +Leader+ or all +Bodyguard+ models are destroyed, the remaining models lose the +Leader+ or +Bodyguard+ keywords, and make their determination of starting strength based on the original uncombined unit's model count.

There is a limitation of one +Leader+ model per +Bodyguard+ unit, unless otherwise permitted by unit data cards.

# Lone Operative

Unless part of an attached unit, this unit cannot be selected as the target of a ranged attack from over 12" away.

# Second in Command

This unit may be attached as a second +Leader+ to a unit that already has a +Leader+

If all +Bodyguard+ models are destroyed, both +Leader+ models become independent units again.

# Secure Objectives

Objective markers controlled by this unit remain under your control, even if you have no models within range of it, unless and until your opponent controls it at any scoring phase.
