# Dead

A Dead Model is one that is at zero (or less) Health.

When a model Dies, immediately resolve its On Death effect (if any), and tip it on its side or use a marker token to indicate that it is Dead.

Dead Models continue to fight for the remainder of the Battle Round. 

Dead Models cannot be healed.

# Half Strength

For single-Model Units, a Unit whose lone Model is at or below half its starting Health, rounded down.

For multiple-Model Units, a Unit with half or fewer its starting quantity of Models, rounded down.

# Model

A single painted figurine.

# Mortal Damage

Damage inflicted to a Model which bypasses any armor saving roll.

# Remove (Model)

Removal of a Model from the Battlefield. The model is considered deceased, however, its "On Death" rules do not activate.

# Roll Off

Both players roll a d6. The player who rolled higher wins the Roll Off. The player who rolled lower loses the Roll Off. If the result was a tie, both players roll again.

# Starting Strength

For single-Model Units, a Unit whose lone Model is at full Health.

For multiple-Model Units, a Unit that has its starting quantity of Models.

# Token

A single painted figurine which, for gameplay purposes, is not considered a "Model". Tokens are most commonly used to represent activation of limited abilities.

# Unit

A group of one or more Models which function as a cohesive team. Each Unit deployed to the battlefield must have a corresponding rules card.

# Unit Coherency

A description of whether or not the Models in a Unit are sufficiently close together.

To be considered "in Unit Coherency":

* Each model must be wholly within the boundaries of the Battlefield, and
* Each Model must be within 2" of one other Model in the Unit (or two other Models in the Unit, for Units with six or more Models), and
* The Unit may not be separated into two or more clusters of Models with a gap greater than 2"

# Unmodified (dice roll)

Numerous effects modify the results of dice rolls. An "Unmodified" roll refers to the raw dice results, before any such alterations are made.
