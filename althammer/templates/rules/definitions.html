# Definitions

<div class="nested-numbered-list">


# Model

A single painted figurine.

# Mortal Damage

Damage inflicted to a Model which bypasses any armor saving roll.

# Remove (Model)

Removal of a Model from the Battlefield. The model is considered deceased, however, its "On Death" rules do not activate.

# Roll Off

Both players roll a d6. The player who rolled higher wins the Roll Off. The player who rolled lower loses the Roll Off. If the result was a tie, both players roll again.

# Unit

A group of one or more Models which function as a cohesive team. Each Unit deployed to the battlefield must have a corresponding rules card.

# Unit Coherency

A description of whether or not the Models in a Unit are sufficiently close together.

To be considered "in Unit Coherency":

    * Each model must be wholly within the boundaries of the Battlefield, and
    * Each Model must be within 2" of one other Model in the Unit (or two other Models in the Unit, for Units with six or more Models), and
    * The Unit may not be separated into two or more clusters of Models with a gap greater than 2"

Units must end all movement - no matter the reason for the movement - in Unit coherency.

At any point in the game (except during a Unit's movement), if a Unit is found to *not* be in Unit Coherency, the player controlling that unit must remove Models from the Unit until Unit Coherency is achieved. When removing Models to achieve Unit Coherency, do not activate On Death rules for the removed Models.

# Unmodified (dice roll)

Numerous effects modify the results of dice rolls. An "Unmodified" roll refers to the raw dice results, before any such alterations are made.
