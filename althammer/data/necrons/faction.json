All dynasties also benefit from the practically supernatural technologies that they once used to dominate the galaxy. Perhaps the most unsettling of these are the Reanimation Protocols. Should a Necron be slain, its body may begin reattaching and reforming, until the Necron rises again to return to battle.",

Each time such a unit restores a point of Health:\n* If the unit contains one or more models below their starting Health, select one of those models; that model regains one point of Health\n* If all models in that unit are at their starting Health, but the unit is below its starting strength, return one destroyed model to the unit with one point of Health remaining.\n* If all models in the unit are at their starting Health and the unit is at its starting strength, nothing happens."
