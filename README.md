# AltHammer
An alternative ruleset for miniature tabletop wargaming in the grim dark future.

# Minis
AltHammer is designed to be played using your existing collection of WarHammer 40,000 miniatures.

# Why use AltHammer over official 40K rules?
Simple:
1. Free: Unlike Games Workshop's official published rules, AltHammer rules are, and will always be, 100% free to use.
2. Simplicity: With AltHammer, you need only the current effective revision of two things: the core rules, and your faction-specific rules and unit cards. No more juggling a physical book, errata notes, printed downloads, a dataslate, the errata for the dataslate, and some random-ass edition of White Dwarf that gives the other guy's Snotling a 2+++ FNP.

And no more buying a physical book that becomes obsolete in three weeks anyways - Rule updates will always be reflected directly in the rule documents and accompanied by changelog notes.
