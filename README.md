# AltHammer
An alternative ruleset for miniature tabletop wargaming

# Minis
AltHammer is designed to be played using your existing collection of WarHammer 40,000 miniatures.

# Lore
AltHammer lore is 100% original, and is in no way derivative.

Humanity is a galaxy-spanning empire, beset on all sides by aliens, abominents, blasphemers, and seditionists.

Forget the promise of science, for so much has been lost. Forget the power of technology, for in the dark grim future, there is only battle. There is no peace in the galaxy, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.

# Why use AltHammer over official 40K rules?
Simple:
1. Free: Unlike Games Workshop's official published rules, AltHammer rules are, and will always be, 100% free to use.
2. Simplicity. With AltHammer, you need only the current effective revision of two documents: the core rules, and your faction-specific rules and unit cards. No more juggling a physical book, errata notes, printed downloads, and some random-ass edition of White Dwarf that gives the other guy's Snotling a 2+++ FNP.

And no more buying a physical book that becomes obsolete in three weeks anyways.
